\title{Extract ranks and weights from clValid object}
\description{
  Creates matrix of ranks and weights from \code{\linkS4class{clValid}}
  object, to use as input for rank aggregation using
  \code{\link[RankAggreg]{RankAggreg}} in package \pkg{RankAggreg}}
\usage{
getRanksWeights(clVObj, measures = measNames(clVObj), nClust =
                nClusters(clVObj), clAlgs = clusterMethods(clVObj))
}
\arguments{
  \item{clVObj}{a clValid object}
  \item{measures}{the cluster validation measures to use for rank aggregation}
  \item{nClust}{the number of clusters to evaluate}
  \item{clAlgs}{the clustering algorithms to evaluate}
}
\details{
  This function extracts cluster validation measures from a
  \code{\linkS4class{clValid}} object, and creates a matrix of rankings
  where each row contains a list of clustering algorithms which are
  ranked according to the validation measure for that row.  The function
  also returns the cluster validation measures as a matrix of weights,
  for use with weighted rank aggregation in the function
  \code{\link[RankAggreg]{RankAggreg}}.  Any combination of validation
  measures, numbers of clusters, and clustering algorithms can be
  selected by the user.  Number of clusters and clustering algorithms
  are appended into a single name.
}
\value{
  A list with components
  \item{ranks}{Matrix with rankings for each validation measure in each row}
  \item{weights}{Matrix of weights, corresponding to the cluster
    validation measures, which are used for weighted rank aggregation}
}
